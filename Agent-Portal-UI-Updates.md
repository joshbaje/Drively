### Before and After

### New Components

**AgentBookingBadge**: A new component created to handle the display of booking information notifications. This component:
- Displays current booking information (dates, status)
- Includes proper positioning and animation
- Handles responsive behavior automatically
- Can be toggled programmatically

```jsx
// AgentBookingBadge.jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './AgentBookingBadge.css';

const AgentBookingBadge = ({ startDate, endDate, status = 'Available' }) => {
  return (
    <div className="agent-booking-badge">
      <div className="booking-badge-status">{status}</div>
      {startDate && endDate && (
        <div className="booking-badge-dates">
          {startDate} - {endDate}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

AgentBookingBadge.propTypes = {
  startDate: PropTypes.string,
  endDate: PropTypes.string,
  status: PropTypes.string
};

export default AgentBookingBadge;
```

```css
/* AgentBookingBadge.css */
.agent-booking-badge {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  right: 0;
  background-color: white;

  padding: 10px 15px;
  min-width: 200px;
  z-index: 2000;
  animation: fadeInDown 0.3s ease-out;
}

@keyframes fadeInDown {
  from {

## Testing Notes

These UI improvements have been tested on the following devices and browsers:

- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Mobile: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- Tablet: iPad Safari

Special attention was given to responsive behavior at the following breakpoints:
- Mobile (< 576px)
- Tablet (576px - 768px)
- Desktop (> 768px)

## Integration Steps

The following steps were taken to implement these UI fixes:

1. **Analysis and Diagnosis**:
   - Identified the primary UI issues through screenshot analysis
   - Inspected the CSS and component structure to locate the problems
   - Created a prioritized list of fixes needed

2. **Component Development**:
   - Created the new AgentBookingBadge component
   - Implemented its styling and animations
   - Added integration with the Agent Portal state management

3. **CSS Refinement**:
   - Updated AgentPortal.css with improved header styling
   - Enhanced VehicleCalendar.css for better layout and responsive behavior
   - Modified VehicleCalendarPage.css to fix the page container styling

4. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Integrated the new component into the AgentPortal.jsx file
   - Added auto-display and hide functionality with useState and useEffect
   - Tested across different viewport sizes to ensure responsive behavior

## How to Use the Booking Badge

The booking badge component is designed to be shown when relevant booking information needs to be displayed to the agent. It will:

1. Automatically appear when the agent's status changes
2. Display for 5 seconds before automatically hiding
3. Show the booking dates and status in a clean, visible format

To manually trigger the booking badge in other components:

```jsx
// Import the component
import AgentBookingBadge from '../../components/agent/AgentBookingBadge';

// Set up state to control visibility
const [showBookingBadge, setShowBookingBadge] = useState(false);
const [bookingInfo, setBookingInfo] = useState({
  startDate: '4/1/2025',
  endDate: '4/15/2025',
  status: 'Pending'
});

// Show the badge when needed
const showBadge = () => {
  setShowBookingBadge(true);
  setTimeout(() => setShowBookingBadge(false), 5000);
};

// In your JSX, conditionally render the badge
{showBookingBadge && (
  <AgentBookingBadge 
    startDate={bookingInfo.startDate}
    endDate={bookingInfo.endDate}
    status={bookingInfo.status}
  />
)}
```

## Future Improvements

While this update addresses the most critical UI issues, some areas for future improvement include:

1. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Adding proper ARIA attributes to custom components
   - Improving keyboard navigation
   - Enhancing screen reader compatibility

2. **Additional Responsive Refinements**:
   - Further optimization for tablets and larger mobile screens
   - Adding more responsive typography
   - Implementing adaptive layouts for critical UI elements

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reducing CSS redundancy
   - Optimizing animations and transitions
   - Implementing code splitting for CSS

## Conclusion

These UI improvements significantly enhance the user experience in the Agent Portal by fixing critical visual issues and improving responsiveness. The addition of the booking badge component provides a clean way to display important booking information to agents, while the CSS fixes ensure proper layout and display across all screen sizes.
