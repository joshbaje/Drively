# Drivelyph Admin Panel - Development Status

## Current Status
The application is a car rental platform with an admin panel that allows for management of vehicles, users, and bookings. The frontend is built using React with React Router for navigation. The backend API integration is currently in development/mock stage.

## Recent Updates: Fleet Calendar Management

A new Fleet Calendar has been added to the Agent Portal. This feature provides agents with a comprehensive view of all vehicles in the fleet, allowing them to see bookings and availability across all vehicles in a single calendar view. Key features include:

- **Fleet-wide Calendar View**: View availability and bookings for all vehicles in a monthly calendar format
- **Vehicle Availability Tracking**: See how many vehicles are available or booked on any given day
- **Detailed Daily View**: Click on any day to see detailed information about vehicle availability and bookings
- **Vehicle Filtering**: Toggle between viewing all vehicles, only booked vehicles, or only available vehicles
- **Quick Actions**: Access vehicle details, individual calendars, or create new bookings directly from the calendar

This feature helps agents efficiently manage the entire fleet and make informed decisions about bookings and vehicle availability.

## Recent Updates: Vehicle Calendar Management
A new vehicle calendar management feature has been added to the Agent Portal. This feature provides a visual way to manage vehicle availability, bookings, and maintenance periods. It allows agents to view a monthly or weekly calendar for each vehicle, showing when the vehicle is booked or unavailable. Agents can add new unavailability periods (for example, when a vehicle needs maintenance) and view detailed information about bookings on specific dates.

The calendar feature also includes a statistics dashboard that shows key metrics about the vehicle, such as utilization rate, total revenue, and upcoming bookings. This helps agents get a quick overview of the vehicle's performance and availability status.

## Recent Updates: Add New Car Feature
The most recent addition is the "Add New Car" feature which allows administrators to add new vehicles to the system. The implementation includes a comprehensive form for vehicle details, image uploads, features management, and status selection.

## How to Access the Feature

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to the Admin Panel
3. Click on "Vehicles" in the sidebar
4. Click the "Add New Vehicle" button in the top-right corner

## Form Sections

The Add New Vehicle form is divided into several sections for better organization:

### Basic Information
- Make (required)
- Model (required)
- Year (required)
- License Plate (required)
- Vehicle Type
- Color

### Pricing & Location
- Daily Rate (required)
- Location

### Owner Information
- Owner ID

### Features & Description
- Vehicle Description (text area)
- Vehicle Features (dynamic list with add/remove functionality)

### Vehicle Images
- Upload up to 5 images
- Image preview with delete option

### Status
- Initial Status (Pending Approval, Approved, Inactive)

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/pages/admin/VehicleCreate.jsx` - Main component for vehicle creation
- `src/pages/admin/VehicleCreate.css` - Styling for the vehicle creation form
- `src/components/admin/AdminRoutes.jsx` - Routes handler for admin panel
- Updates to `src/pages/admin/AdminPage.jsx` to use the AdminRoutes component

### Features
- Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop
- Form validation for required fields
- Dynamic feature list with add/remove functionality
- Image upload with preview and delete options
- Status selection with information tooltip
- Success screen with options to add another vehicle or return to vehicle management

### Current Limitations
- All data is currently mock data, including vehicles, users, and bookings
- Form submissions do not persist as there is no backend connectivity yet
- Images can be uploaded but are not stored permanently
- Navigation between sections works but some deep-linking may not function as expected

## Next Development Steps
1. Connect all forms to the backend API when available
2. Implement proper image upload and storage with CDN integration
3. Add comprehensive validation for all inputs including image file types and sizes
4. Implement owner search functionality with autocomplete
5. Add auto-complete for make/model fields based on a vehicle database
6. Implement proper authentication and authorization flows
7. Add booking management and calendar functionality
8. Implement payment processing integration
9. Add reporting and analytics dashboards

## Usage Notes
- The application is using mock data for demonstration purposes
- The form is currently in demo mode and does not persist data
- Default status for new vehicles is "Pending Approval"
- A success message is shown when the form is submitted successfully, but the data is not saved
- Most features are visual demonstrations without backend functionality

## Application Structure
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages` - Page-level components organized by feature
- `/src/context` - React context providers for state management
- `/src/services` - Service modules for API communication (currently mocked)
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/assets` - Static assets like images and icons

## Getting Started For Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
5. Login with mock credentials (admin/admin) to access the admin panel
