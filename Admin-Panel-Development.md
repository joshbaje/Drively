# Drivelyph Car Rental Platform - Admin Panel Development

## Overview

This document provides information about the admin panel implementation for the Drivelyph car rental platform. The admin panel is designed to help administrators manage users, vehicles, bookings, and system settings efficiently.

## Components Created

1. **AdminDashboard**
   - Overview of platform statistics
   - Quick access to common functions
   - Recent activity feed
   - Visual representations of key metrics

2. **UserManagement**
   - User listing with filtering and search
   - User detail view
   - User status management (active/inactive)
   - Role-based management

3. **VehicleManagement**
   - Vehicle listing with filtering and search
   - Vehicle approval workflow
   - Vehicle detail view
   - Status management (available, rented, maintenance, unlisted)

4. **BookingManagement**
   - Booking listing with filtering and search
   - Booking status management
   - Payment status tracking
   - Detailed booking information

## API Integration

The admin panel integrates with the Drivelyph backend API:

- Base API URL: `https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:a2Nn2Kno`
- Authentication API URL: `https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:scA8Isc8`

Authentication is handled through JWT tokens, and all admin API endpoints require admin role permissions.

## Admin Routes

The following routes have been added to the application:

- `/admin` - Main admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/vehicles` - Vehicle management
- `/admin/bookings` - Booking management

All admin routes are protected and require the 'admin' role to access.

## Role-Based Access Control

The ProtectedRoute component has been updated to support a more comprehensive role system:

1. **admin** - Full access to admin panel and all functions
2. **super_admin** - Extended privileges for system configuration
3. **owner** - Basic car owner account
4. **verified_owner** - Owner with verified identity
5. **premium_owner** - Owner with premium subscription
6. **business_owner** - Business entity with multiple vehicles
7. **renter** - Basic renter account
8. **verified_renter** - Renter with verified identity
9. **premium_renter** - Renter with premium subscription
10. **support_agent** - Customer support role
11. **finance_admin** - Access to financial data and reporting
12. **content_manager** - Can manage website content

## Implementation Details

All components follow a consistent pattern:
- State management using React hooks
- Filtering and searching capability
- Pagination for large data sets
- Modal dialogs for detailed views
- Status update mechanisms

The admin panel uses a sidebar layout with responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the API Integration**
   - Replace mock data with real API calls
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states for API operations

2. **Implement Additional Admin Pages**
   - VerificationManagement - For managing user document verification
   - ReportingDashboard - For financial reports and analytics
   - SystemSettings - For platform configuration

3. **Enhance Security**
   - Implement more granular permission checks
   - Add audit logging for admin actions

4. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Bulk operations (approve/reject multiple vehicles)
   - Export data to CSV/Excel
   - Dashboard customization

## Getting Started

To work on the admin panel:

1. Familiarize yourself with the component structure
2. Understand the API endpoints and authentication mechanism
3. Start by connecting the existing components to real data
4. Implement additional features and pages as needed

## Testing

Make sure to test the admin panel with various user roles to ensure proper access control and functionality.
